// Example Gahoot config
//
// Keys are formed by placing the config key before a colon and the
// desired value after. Eg:
//	key: "value pair"
//
// Lines beginning with "//" or which are blank are discarded
//
// Some options accept multiple options as an array. To write this,
// place options between square braces on new lines. Eg:
//	key: [
//		value1
//		value2
//	]
// If only one option is wished, it can be passed as normal. Eg:
//	key: value1
// Blank lines are not permitted between array braces. The first brace
// must be on the same line as the key and the last on a newline.
//
// Not all options are required. They can be omitted or left blank.
